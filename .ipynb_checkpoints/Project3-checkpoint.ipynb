    "This notebook is my project 'Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data' submission. 'Data wrangling' is what the process of collecting and cleaning data is often called. Having completed the project means I am able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.\n",
    "- Parse and gather data from an xml file.\n",
    "- Process data from a very large file that can be cleaned programmatically.\n",
    "- Store, query, and aggregate data using SQL.\n",
    "- OpenStreetMap (OSM) is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, buildings, restaurants, railway stations and much more, all over the world. Since any person can register on OSM and start editing a map, it is only natural that some of the data is not valid, accurate, complete, consistent or uniform."

It is extremely easy to input incorrect or mistyped information for a dataset this large. Knowing how to audit, clean, and update the data is a very useful skill when working on dataset of this magnitude. Although the dataset is in generally complete, valid, and accurate, its quality regarding consistency can be improved."
